## üî¨ Technical Deep Dive

### Synthetic Data Generation with Market Realism
```python
# Advanced brand modeling with market intelligence
brand_profiles = {
    'Honda': {
        'luxury_factor': False, 
        'reliability_score': 0.89,
        'price_range': (15000, 45000),
        'depreciation_rate': 0.85,

    }
}

# Complex pricing algorithm with market dynamics
def calculate_market_price(base_specs, brand_profile):
    price = base_specs['msrp']
    
    # Apply depreciation curve
    price *= (brand_profile['depreciation_rate'] ** base_specs['age'])
    
    # Performance adjustments
    power_weight_ratio = base_specs['horsepower'] / base_specs['weight']
    price *= (1 + (power_weight_ratio - 0.1) * 0.5)
    
    # Brand reliability premium
    price *= (0.8 + brand_profile['reliability_score'] * 0.4)
    
    return price
